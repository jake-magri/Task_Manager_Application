# Task_Manager_Application
Full stack ASP.NET web application using PostgreSQL as database, written in C#, HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript maybe some angular when I get there. 
At time of repository creation just finished using  Fluent API and a LOT of Bash debugging to migrate DB to Visual Studio ASP.NET Web App project. This is a portfolio project and learning experience.
